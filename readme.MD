# Netflix Clone

This project is part of the Software Verification and Validation course. The goal is to create a cloned version of the Netflix sign-in page and perform login operations, with subsequent testing using Selenium.

## Usage
To get started, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, you'll need the ChromeDriver for Selenium to work. If you're using a Mac, you can install it by opening a terminal and running:

```bash
brew install chromedriver
```

Make sure to have these dependencies in place before running the project.
